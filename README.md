## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues**

#### **System Won't Start**
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Verify dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check database connectivity
python -c "from app.database import engine; print('DB OK')"
```

#### **AI Analysis Not Working**
```bash
# Verify AI model installation
python -c "import torch; print('PyTorch OK')"

# Check GPU availability
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Test AI endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ai/test
```

#### **Browser Compatibility Issues**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Update to latest browser version

### **Performance Issues**
- **Slow Loading** - Check network connection and clear cache
- **High Memory Usage** - Restart browser or reduce open tabs
- **Database Timeouts** - Check database server status
- **AI Processing Delays** - Verify model files and GPU availability
