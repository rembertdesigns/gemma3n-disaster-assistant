## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ Database Connection Errors:**

Check database file permissions
```
ls -la data/emergency_response.db
```
# Reset database
```
rm data/emergency_response.db
python api.py  # Recreates database
```

**❌ AI Model Loading Issues:**

Check system resources
```
python -c "import psutil; print(f'RAM: {psutil.virtual_memory().available/1e9:.1f}GB')"
```
# Test AI components
```
python -c "from api import gemma_processor; print('AI Ready')"
```

**❌ Voice Recognition Problems:**

- Check browser compatibility
- Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+

- Test microphone permissions
- Visit: chrome://settings/privacy


**❌ WebSocket Connection Issues:**
```js
// Test WebSocket connection
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws/dashboard');
ws.onopen = () => console.log('Connected');
ws.onerror = (error) => console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
```

### Performance Optimization

**⚡ Speed Improvements:**

Enable database connection pooling
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host/db
```

Use Redis for caching
```
pip install redis
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

Optimize AI settings
```
export AI_MODEL_VARIANT=gemma-3n-2b  # Smaller, faster model
export AI_CONTEXT_WINDOW=32000       # Reduced context for speed
```

**💾 Memory Optimization:**

Limit concurrent requests
```
export WORKER_PROCESSES=2
export MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=50
```

Enable garbage collection
```
export PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1
```

### Debug Mode

**🐛 Enable Detailed Logging:**
```
export DEBUG=true
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python3 api.py
```

**🔍 Inspect Database:**

In Python shell
```
from api import engine
from sqlalchemy import inspect

inspector = inspect(engine)
print(inspector.get_table_names())
```
